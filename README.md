# Momo

2020 update: Momo is now defunct, and should no longer be used. Please use its successor, [Poyo](https://github.com/ecj2/poyo), instead.

~~Momo is a simple 2D game-making library written in JavaScript. It abstracts common tasks—such as managing mouse and keyboard events, drawing text and images, and playing sounds—behind an easy-to-use interface.~~

~~Momo works on modern Web browsers which support WebGL 2, such as desktop versions of Chrome and Firefox.~~
